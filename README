Q: what is this??
A: it's a bash script for downloading files from tallyall.club or the
   cojumpendium archive.

Q: how does this work and how do i use it??
A: it downloads the main page for the release and artist and then searches
   the keyword specified in the page, then rips the download url from that.

   tallyall [artist] [release] [keyword]
   artist:  cd - cojum dip (uses cojumpendium archive)
            th - tally hall (uses tallyall.club)
            mm - miracle musical (uses tallyall.club)
   release: check with tallyall [artist] [insert keyboard spam here]
   keyword: a word in the song title

   for example, to download the sacred beast demo from admittedly incomplete
   demos, you'd run tallyall th aid sacred. this looks up the keyword "sacred"
   in the admittedly incomplete demos page and finds the 2nd mention of it
   (usually the displayed file name with directory lister) and uses that to
   download the final file.

Q: this is some disgusting code. SURELY you can clean it up
A: first of all, not a question; second of all, i know. and i will eventually.
   if i don't, it's your job to clean it up. because fuck you.
